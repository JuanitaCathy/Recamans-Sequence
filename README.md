# Recamán's Sequence Visualizer 🌀

## Overview

This JavaScript script generates a visualization of Recamán's Sequence, an integer sequence defined by a simple rule. The sequence is visualized using arcs, creating an evolving pattern that showcases the beauty of mathematical structures.
I have written a blog for the same where the mathematical detail of Recamán's is explained!

## Recamán's Sequence

Recamán's Sequence is defined by the following rule:

- Start with 0.
- If the current term is greater than 0 and has not been previously used, move backward; otherwise, move forward.
- At each step, the new term is the absolute difference between the current term and the last term chosen.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file containing the script in a web browser.
2. Witness the mesmerizing visualization of Recamán's Sequence.
3. The sequence continues to evolve with each step, revealing intricate patterns.

## Technologies used

- **JavaScript:**
  - For a dynamic and interactive visualization.

- **P5.js Library:**
  - For simplifying the creation of graphics and animations.

## Setup

1. Open the HTML file in a compatible web browser.
2. Enjoy the visual representation of Recamán's Sequence.
